Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and welcome responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it **privately** through GitHub’s [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/Sashaa1230/asha-empowers-her/security/advisories/new).  
Do **not** create a public issue — this helps protect users while we investigate and resolve the problem.

### What to include in your report:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fix (optional)

### What happens next:
- We’ll acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**.
- We’ll provide an update within **5–7 business days** with a plan and timeline.
- Once the issue is resolved, we’ll credit your contribution (if desired) and optionally publish an advisory.

Thank you for helping us keep the project secure! ❤️
